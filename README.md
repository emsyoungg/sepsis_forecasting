# Assessing the Generalisability of Time Series Forecasting Models for ICU Digital Twins
This repository contains the code and data used for the paper "Assessing the Generalisability of Time Series Forecasting Models for ICU Digital Twins" by Emily Young.

Regarding the data, I have used the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset. The data is available at [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/static/published-project/saebicmimic-iii/). The data is not included in this repository due to its size and licensing restrictions. Please refer to the MIMIC-III documentation for instructions on how to access the data.

Regarding the structure of the project, custom made classes have been made to load and clean data, and evaluate models. The experiments using these classes and testing models are in ipynb files.
